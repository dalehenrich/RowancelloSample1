# RowancelloSample1
Sample project for working with Rowan V4 projects generated by Rowancello.

The project should be loaded into a stone with Rowancello already installed. At the moment this project should be loaded into the stone as the `seaside` user, since that's the primary user for Rowancello development.

At this stage of the project, the RowanExtensions component will be adding new Rowan classes with experimental cluster and subcluster support classes. 

The focus will be on building class structure that can represent the package metadata for Metacello projects ... and more amenable to specifying the project/package/clustterer/subcluster releationships in a Jadeite GUI.

The first round of work will also involve supporting conditional expressions using the [RwCAQ](https://github.com/GemTalk/RwCAQ) project.
